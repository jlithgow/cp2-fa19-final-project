Project deconstruction | Personal GAN image creation model:

Goal:
  Feed a GAN a ton of renderings of abstract artwork I've created and then get it to create new images. Fine tune these images after until I get artwork that I like (extremely subjective).

Data:
  - Images to train from ~250;

Interaction:
  - "Seed" image for new image creation;
